# windows-tool
Welcome on my tool project, which I actively upgrade the quality of. The main purpose of this program is to enhance my programming skills while having fun doing so. The quality of the programs available in this project is not very high, but I will try to improve it by coding more and more.

You can do whatever you want with my programs, use it, edit it, claim it as your own, not caring about it, whatever.
All of my work are open-source, and I don't intend to hide anything malicious in there.
I accept and appreciate any comments/critics, as I think that it's a good way to improve what's bad and not optimisated in my programs.

My programs dev languages are currently only focused on Python, but it may change in the future.
